    "# How to Create a Dataframe on School Sport Equity:\n",

    "This notebook will walk you through a tutorial on how to gather a subset of data relating to School Sport Equity using python. We are asking ourselves the question: What collegiate sport do most women tend to play and is their revenue ever higher than men's sports in North Carolina?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure that you have Anaconda downloaded to your computer to get started. When the Anaconda software is up, start up Jupyter Lab. And create a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You have to install packages using the python import function or else the package's functions will not be available to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas allow us to store our data as dataframes with familiar features like rows, columns, and headers (similar to Microsoft Excel). Pandas will allow you to manage and manipulate large sets of tabular data so it's easier to read for particular pieces of information you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy will help us compute math more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by importing the pandas package using the following command:\n",
    "Type in your cell `import pandas as pd` and `import numpy as np`. Then, shift return/enter to run the code. Shown below:"

    "You should have the .csv file titled \"SchoolSportEquity.csv\" in your directory. To do this, you need to quit Anaconda and save the .csv file into the folder that you are using for your directory. After that is complete, reopen Anaconda and it should appear in your directory. The name of the file (SchoolSportEquity) will be used to guide the code from that particular file.\n",

    "#### How To Code Your Dataframe\n",

    "You'll need to make a variable to define your dataframe to make it easier on yourself to code. In this instance, we will use **df** (dataframe). To access your data, you'll need to code: `df=pd.read_csv(\"SchoolSportEquity.csv\")` The `pd.read_csv` code will read the tabular data from a .csv file into a dataframe object within the jupyter lab notebook. \n",
