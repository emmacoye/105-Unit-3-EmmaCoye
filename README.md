##### Aquiring The Data  
This data came from the [U.S. Department of Education](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/). The Department of Education showcases its equity in sports through data analysis. In this website, you will be able to find information on many universities and data pertaining to their sports teams. The data used was from the most recent year of data. 

##### What Is The Data's Purpose? 
This repository has been made to provide a publicly accessible and reproducible dataset for those interested in eqiuity in athletics in U.S. universities.  Our end goal is to create a subset of data that will answer the question: What collegiate sport do most women tend to play in North Carolina? This process can be reproduced with any level of expertise of Python3.

##### Potential Use
This is a repository containing instructional information on how use Python3 and the Pandas package to answer the following question: What collegiate sport do most women tend to play in North Carolina? I created this repository because I had a personal interest in college athletics. As a female athlete, it has taken many years for us to be recognized on a national level. In hope to bring more attention to women's sports, this repository will provide instructions to provide data about the total amount of collegiete female athletes and their sport's revenue.

### Within this repository you will find three files. 

##### 1. A .csv file containing the original set of data that relates to college sports equity.
This .csv file contains many colleges and universities around the United States. It includes information on the university, total amount of female players for a sport and the total amount of male players from a sport. The file shows the amount of coaches (female and male), revenue gained from each sport, etc.

##### 2. A python notebook including steps on how to code in Python3 with the Pandaas package to create a subset of the original set of data.

##### 3. A .csv file containing the subset of data from the original .csv file.
This .csv file contains information on North Carolina universities and colleges' sports teams. It includes the name of the university, total amount of female players for a sport, and the total amount of male players from a sport. The file also shows the amount of revenue gained from each women's sport and men's sport.


#### Main Women Sports Results
![Main Women Sports](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118199042/202936609-38dadd66-a4f1-4efd-be9e-7e093073784e.png)

The visuzaltion shown was produced through [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/). Taking the top collegiete sports, this displays how many women are in those sports. To do this we had to manually crunch the numbers for each of these five sports. 

#### How To Manually Add Data
Open the subset of data through your preferred software. Proceed to add a new column and begin to type "=". This will start a formula. After the equals sign, click on the cell that include women participants in the preferred sport. Press the "+" and click the next cell down with a new school, but with the same sport. This is a tedious process, so make sure you double check that all the cells clicked are for that particular sport. Continue this process until the end of the spreadsheet and for the other preferred sports that you will like to compare data with. You can then export this file by pressing "file" and "export to". Save the file as a .csv file and upload to your Flourish account.
