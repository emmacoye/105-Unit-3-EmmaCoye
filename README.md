# 105-Unit-3-EmmaCoye

This is a repository containing instructional information on how use Python3 and the Pandas package to answer the following question: What collegiate sport do most women tend to play and is their revenue ever higher than men's sports in North Carolina?

### Acknowledgements

The instructions provided are from resources from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill's English 105 course. These resources were from materials provided by the Davis Library Research Hub.

### Within this repository you will find three files. 

##### 1. A .csv file containing the original set of data that relates to college sports equity.

This .csv file contains many colleges and universities around the United States. It includes information on the university, total amount of female players for a sport and the total amount of male players from a sport. The file shows the amount of coaches (female and male), revenue gained from each sport, etc.

##### 2. A python notebook including steps on how to code in Python3 with the Pandaas package to create a subset of the original set of data.

##### 3. A .csv file containing the subset of data from the original .csv file.

This .csv file contains information on North Carolina universities and colleges' sports teams. It includes the name of the university, total amount of female players for a sport, and the total amount of male players from a sport. The file also shows the amount of revenue gained from each women's sport and men's sport.

##### Aquiring This Data (where did this data/code come frome?) 

This data came from the [U.S. Department of Education](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/).

PUPROSE (what/who is this data/code for?)
POTENTIAL (why was this repo created, and what might people do with it?)
You'll also need to include any procedural information, whether functional or contextual, that users will need in order to access, open, and run your python notebooks.

### Our end goal is to create a subset of data that will answer the question: What collegiate sport do most women tend to play and is their revenue ever higher than men's sports in North Carolina?
